# Lab 1: Evaluating Machine Learning Models

In this lab session, we will focus on the evaluation of machine learning models.

The lab is divided into three parts:

1. [Part 1: Metrics for Evaluating ML Models](./lab/metrics.md)
2. [Part 2: Understanding metrics for regression](./lab/regression.ipynb)
3. [Part 3: Understanding metrics for classification](./lab/classification.ipynb)

### Useful and advanced reading
